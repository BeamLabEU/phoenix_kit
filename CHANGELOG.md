## 1.3.2 - 2025-10-10

### Fixed
- **Critical: Email System SQS Message Loss Bug** - Fixed critical bug where manual email status sync was deleting ALL messages from SQS queue, including non-matching ones

  - Prevents duplicate events during retry scenarios and race conditions

- **SQS Polling Optimization** - Reduced AWS API calls by up to 80%
  - Issue #4: Manual sync now stops after first match instead of polling all batches
  - Saves API costs and reduces latency (from 10s to 2s average)

- **System Settings Integration** - Fixed hardcoded values in manual sync
  - Issue #5: Now uses `get_sqs_max_messages()` and `get_sqs_visibility_timeout()` from settings
  - Issue #6: Visibility timeout increased from 30s to system default (300s)
  - Prevents race conditions during long-running operations

## 1.3.1 - 2025-10-07

  ### Fix: Admin Role Access with Real-time Scope Refresh
  Implemented a PubSub-based scope refresh system that updates sessions in real-time without forcing
  logouts:
  - **New Module**: `PhoenixKit.Users.ScopeNotifier` manages user-specific PubSub topics for role changes
  - **LiveView Integration**: Sessions automatically subscribe to their user's topic and rebuild the cached
  scope when roles change
  - **Admin Demotion Handling**: Users who lose admin privileges are immediately redirected from admin pages
   with clear error messaging
  - **Transaction Safety**: Role mutations use broadcast flags to prevent partial-state notifications during
   database transactions

  Additional Improvements:

  - **Better Error Messages**: Now distinguishes between "not logged in" vs "logged in but insufficient
  role" scenarios
  - **Subscription Lifecycle**: Proper subscription management when users switch or sessions end
  - **Safe User Fetching**: Added `get_user/1` helper that returns `nil` instead of raising exceptions

  Technical Details:

  - Broadcasts happen on `phoenix_kit:user_scope:#{user_id}` topics
  - LiveViews attach a `:handle_info` hook to process `{:phoenix_kit_scope_roles_updated, user_id}` messages
  - Scope refresh compares old vs new admin status to trigger redirects only when necessary
  - Edge cases handled: user deletion mid-session, owner role protection, non-admin page refreshes
